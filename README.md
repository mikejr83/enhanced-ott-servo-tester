# Enhanced Over-the-Top Servo Tester

Enhanced version of OTT Servo Tester by MajicDesigns OTT Servo Tester: https://github.com/MajicDesigns/OTTServoTester

My version of the project using a Raspberry Pi Pico, an OLED display, and a different interface to accomplish the same end goal.

This branch is using waveshare's library worked into an class structure to utilize its 1.5 OLED RGB display.

While the code in this branch works, I suggest not using it. I'm leaving it here for reference. I'm going to pivot to using the Adafruit libraries.
